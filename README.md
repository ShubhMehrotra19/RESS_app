1. **Login Screen**:  
   Users are prompted to enter their Employee Number and Password.

2. **Backend Authentication**:
   - Sends a POST request to the endpoint:  
     `http://<server-ip>:8080/api/v1/auth/login`
   - Payload:
     ```json
     {
       "employee_number": "<EMPLOYEE_NUMBER>",
       "password": "<PASSWORD>"
     }
     ```

3. **Validation**:  
   - If the login is successful (`200 OK`), the user is redirected to the **Home** screen.
   - If invalid credentials are provided, an error message is displayed.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Handles network errors, timeout issues, and invalid responses gracefully.
